Analytics platforms apply Data Sampling algorithms when the number of records used to create a report exceeds some limit.
When this happens, analytics platforms perform calculations on only a subset of records and then extrapolate the result to all records.
This leads to inaccuracies in calculations, which can have a <b>critical impact</b> on business judgments.

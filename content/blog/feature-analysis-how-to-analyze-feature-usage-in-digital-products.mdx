## How to Analyze Feature Usage in Digital Products

Welcome back! Now that we know what features are, let's talk about something crucial - **feature analysis**. If you don't measure how your features are being used, you're basically flying blind. So, how do we track this effectively?

### Why Track Feature Usage?

Let's say you launch a new feature. How do you know if users are actually using it? How do you know if it's helping them? That's where **analytics** come in! Here are three key questions to ask:

- **Which features are used the most?**
- **Which features help convert free users into paying customers?**
- **Is feature usage growing over time?**

### Building a Feature Analysis Dashboard

A great way to answer these questions is by setting up a **feature analysis dashboard**. It should include:

- 📊 **A high-level overview** of all core features
- 🔍 **A detailed breakdown** of how individual features are being used
- 📈 **A retention report** to see if users keep engaging with a feature over time

🚀 **Pro Tip:** Use event tracking and cohort analysis to understand long-term feature engagement.

### Example: Blog Features

Take **Blog** as an example. You might want to track:

- How many users **create posts**
- How many users **publish regularly**
- How these activities **impact subscriber growth**

These insights help teams understand what's working and what's not.

### The Takeaway

Feature analysis is your best friend if you want to improve your product. Understanding usage patterns helps teams iterate effectively.

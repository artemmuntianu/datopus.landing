### The Challenge

AcmeTech, a fast-growing SaaS company, offers a multi-tenant collaboration platform serving businesses of all sizes. As the company scales, its product team struggles to gain insights into user behavior across its <code>100</code> tenants and <code>30,000</code> monthly active users. Each user generates an average of <code>25</code> events per month, totaling <code>75</code> million events. AcmeTech needs a robust product analytics solution that provides deep insights without breaking the budget.

Additionally, AcmeTech's product and engineering teams want to minimize the time spent on complex event tracking setup and ongoing maintenance. They need a solution that is easy to integrate and maintain, reducing the operational burden on their developers and analysts.

### The Evaluation Process

The AcmeTech team identifies six leading product analytics solutions: Datopus, Statsig, Posthog, Woopra, Mixpanel, and Amplitude. Their evaluation criteria include:

- Cost efficiency – Can the platform support <code>75M</code> events at a reasonable price?
- Feature set – Does the platform offer core analytics features such as user segmentation, funnel analysis, retention tracking, and custom dashboards?
- Data source compatibility – Can the platform integrate with key data sources such as databases, data warehouses, CRMs, and customer event streams?
- Ease of integration and maintenance – How easy is it to integrate the solution into their multi-tenant architecture, and how much effort is required to maintain it over time?
- Scalability – Can the platform handle future growth without exponential cost increases?
- Support & flexibility – Does the platform offer good support and customization options?

### Pricing Comparison

For <code>100</code> tenants, <code>30K</code> users, and <code>75M</code> events per month, the pricing structure for each platform is:

- Datopus – $1,600
- Statsig – $3,650
- Posthog – $5,254
- Woopra – $14,999
- Mixpanel – $20,720

### Why AcmeTech Chose Datopus

After evaluating the available options, AcmeTech concluded that Datopus was the best solution due to the following key advantages:

2. **Feature-Rich & Multi-Tenant Friendly**: Unlike Mixpanel and Amplitude, which lack built-in multi-tenant support, Datopus is designed to natively support multi-tenant architectures.
3. **Minimal Setup & Maintenance Effort**: Datopus provides event auto-tracking, reducing the engineering effort required to set up and maintain event tracking compared to other platforms.
4. **Scalability Without Cost Explosions**: Competing platforms increase costs exponentially as event volume grows, while Datopus maintains a predictable, budget-friendly pricing model.
5. **Data Source Integration**: Datopus integrates with Google Analytics and BigQuery, allowing AcmeTech to leverage existing data without requiring additional costly infrastructure.
6. **24/7 Customer Support & Customization**: Unlike some competitors, Datopus provides round-the-clock support and customizable analytics solutions tailored to AcmeTech's needs.

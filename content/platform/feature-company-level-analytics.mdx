In the competitive world of B2B SaaS, offering value to each client is crucial for growth and retention. But how can your company gain deep insights into how individual customers use your product, and identify opportunities for improvement or upselling? The answer lies in company-level analytics.
<br><br>

### **What is Company-Level Analytics?**
<br>
Company-level analytics refers to the ability to track, monitor, and analyze the data of each individual company that uses your SaaS platform. Unlike general metrics that aggregate data across all users, company-level analytics provides a granular look at how each client engages with your product. This insight allows you to see which features they use most, where they may be facing challenges, and how they are benefiting from your platform.
<br><br>
With company-level analytics, you can tailor your approach to each client based on the data, allowing for a much more personalized experience that drives better outcomes for both your business and your customers.
<br><br>

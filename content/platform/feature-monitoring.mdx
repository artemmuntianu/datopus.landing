Data analytics helps you see what's working and what's not. It's the key to making smart decisions.
<br><br>

For example, if mobile actions drop, it's time to rethink your mobile user experience. Adapting quickly to changes is crucial in the digital world.

Changes in product category purchases reveal market trends. This helps you target high-performing segments and address declines.
